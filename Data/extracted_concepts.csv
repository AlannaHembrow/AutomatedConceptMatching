The hierarchies defined by ModelVariant and ModelRevision are orthogonal in that the Model Variants of a parent Model and the Model Revisions of the same parent may be incompatible. Moreover, the child Model of a ModelVariant may not be the parent of a ModelRevision, but the child Model of a ModelRevision may be the parent of a ModelVariant.

NOTE: This is different from a Model's Bill of Materials (BOM), which describes the decomposition of a single model into its sub-model child parts with associated quantities of each.

Moreover, the child Model of a ModelVariant may not be the parent of a ModelRevision, but the child Model of a ModelRevision may be the parent of a ModelVariant.

NOTE: This is different from a Model's Bill of Materials (BOM), which describes the decomposition of a single model into its sub-model child parts with associated quantities of each.

NOTE: This is different from a Model Revision in that the child Model is always a restricted version of the parent Model as a result of some combination of selections defined on the parent, rather than a new ""release"" of the parent model."
